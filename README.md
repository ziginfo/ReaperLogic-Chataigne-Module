## OSC Control for Reaper  with Chataigne
In Chataigne you will find this module under "Software" and "Community Modules" with the name of "Reaper-Logic" !    

 You must activate OSC in the Reaper's Preferences. You should use the Custom-File named "LogicPad" OSC-Configuration file.... This Custom-File takes all the OSC-Adresses used by the Touch-OSC-Template for Logic-Pro
 You will find more informations here : http://www.cockos.com/reaper/sdk/osc/osc.php  

The OSC-Remote-Port can be 7000; the Local Port for feedback from Reaper can be 9000 or any other...  

Have Fun
